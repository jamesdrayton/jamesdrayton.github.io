Use 'npm run start' in this directory to run the app in a test server or view it at https://jamesdrayton.github.io

This is the React app for the github pages site containing my resume, my about page, and a summary of my github projects.
All projects will have links to their github repositories and summaries of their purpose and the tools used to make them.
Projects with working demos will also have links to those demos hosted elsewhere on the github pages site.

App.js imports all of the HTML from the pages and tells the browser what to display in response to use input on the webpage.

About.js, Projects.js, Contact.js, and Navbar.js contain HTML used by App.js

Demo.js contains HTML used by App.js, but it also interacts with external js files running demos which open on a separate page.

TODO:
1. Write git notepage
2. Write powershell cmdlet for automatically updating
3. Write footnotes popup to supplement about page copy
4. Write more comprehensive projects explanations in their demo pages or in the footnotes popup
